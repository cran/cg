
27 November 2011: Version 0.9-2
-------------------------------

* Fixed bug in print method of cgOneFactorComparisonsTable object when addpct=TRUE is
specified for comparison of groups on untransformed data. Thanks to Journal of
Statistics (JSS) anonymous reviewer of submitted paper of cg package for reporting
this bug.

* For output from the comparisonsTable method, the label "geomean" is used in place
for "mean" to make clear that geometric means are displayed. Thanks to JSS anonymous 
reviewer for remarks that led to the decision of this label change.

* Added simple print and summary methods for the cgOneFactorFit object, again thanks
to a suggestion of a JSS reviewer.

26 June 2011: Version 0.9-1
---------------------------

* Changed calls of VGAM:::cnormal1 to VGAM:::cennormal1 due to rename in 
VGAM package when version 0.8-3 was released 17 June 2011.

now requires >= R 2.12.0 and VGAM >= 0.8-3.

DESCRIPTION FILE.

0.9.0 (on 20 December 2010) to 0.9-1 .
