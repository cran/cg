11 March 2012: Version 0.9-4
-------------------------------

* Discovered and fixed bug of stamp that notes the graph symbols used for boxplot() method

* Dependency on R 2.14.0 and VGAM 0.8.6 or greater was tested and clarified after
finding CRAN warnings.

10 March 2012: Version 0.9-3
-------------------------------

* Cleaned up plotting of one-factor group level names on the x-axis when they are
rotated, by making sure there is clear whitespace between the right end of each
group name label and the x-axis.

* Cleaned up bad mixing of base graphics and grid/lattice functions in cgDevice(),
which did not allow file output graphics devices to work properly.

27 November 2011: Version 0.9-2
-------------------------------

* Fixed bug in print method of cgOneFactorComparisonsTable object when addpct=TRUE is
specified for comparison of groups on untransformed data. Thanks to Journal of
Statistics (JSS) anonymous reviewer of submitted paper of cg package for reporting
this bug.

* For output from the comparisonsTable method, the label "geomean" is used in place
for "mean" to make clear that geometric means are displayed. Thanks to JSS anonymous 
reviewer for remarks that led to the decision of this label change.

* Added simple print and summary methods for the cgOneFactorFit object, again thanks
to a suggestion of a JSS reviewer.

26 June 2011: Version 0.9-1
---------------------------

* Changed calls of VGAM:::cnormal1 to VGAM:::cennormal1 due to rename in 
VGAM package when version 0.8-3 was released 17 June 2011. 

* Since VGAM 0-8.3 would not load in R 2.11 in my Windows installation, the cg package
now requires >= R 2.12.0 and VGAM >= 0.8-3.

* Removed duplication of author and maintained email address contact in the
DESCRIPTION FILE.

0.9.0 (on 20 December 2010) to 0.9-1 .
