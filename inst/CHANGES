---------------------------

* Changed calls of VGAM:::cnormal1 to VGAM:::cennormal1 due to rename in 
VGAM package when version 0.8-3 was released 17 June 2011. 

* Since VGAM 0-8.3 would not load in R 2.11 in my Windows installation, the cg package
now requires >= R 2.12.0 and VGAM >= 0.8-3.

* Removed duplication of author and maintained email address contact in the
DESCRIPTION FILE.

* Switched to more conventional packae number versioning (from initial release
0.9.0 (on 20 December 2010) to 0.9-1 .

* No functional changes were made in the package in this release.

* Added this CHANGES file.
