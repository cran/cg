12 April 2025: Version 1.0-4
===========================
* Addressed long standing CRAN check notes, and updated to proper syntax, per request from CRAN team, to properly anchor .Rd file links to imported package functions. There are no functionality changes in this release.

04 January 2016: Version 1.0-3
===========================
* Addressed notes arising in building process, in order to follow CRAN and R-core and R-extensions guidelines and standards for packages, 
such as export and import directives in the NAMESPACE file and Title in the DESCRIPTION file. 

31 December 2014: Version 1.0-2
===========================
* Fixed missing requirements of digits argument in the comparisonsGraph method for OneFactor and PairedDifference
objects. The main error appeared when graphing the min and max digits range of "differences". 
This discovery happened when data was fit and analyzed in its original scale. 
The default logarithmic scale case was unaffected since the min and max "percent/ratio difference" numbers does not 
need the missing digits= argument. 

* Fixed an oversight to check that if the refgrp= argument is used in a comparisonsTable call for a OneFactorFit
object, then the type= argument needs to be also set to "allgroupstocontrol."  Thanks again to Vince Pileggi for
reporting these bugs.

* Corrected placement of warning message in samplesizeGraph() calls when the calculated sample sizes are greater than a specified threshold (default 1000). This placement is based on the largest.empty() function in Frank Harrell's Hmisc package. 

13 July 2014: Version 1.0-1
===========================

* Fixed a graph render error where logscale=FALSE was not specified in setting up x-axis ticks
  for the comparisonsGraph() method for cgOneFactorComparisonsTable objects when the endpoint is
  analyzed in the original (not transformed) scale. Thanks to Vince Pileggi for reporting the error.

* Revised Authors fields in documentation to reflect creator, contributor roles, etc. with the recent syntax
  enhancements.

* deprecated an internal, non-exported function validDataFormat(); replaced by validArgMatch()

* Reformatted this file to conform to R special requirements. Thanks go to Hadley Wickam and his
  http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Documenting-packages.html link to clarify that for me. 

14 February 2014: Version 1.0-0
===============================

* Added paired samples methods and functions, with a base label "PairedDifference".  

* Removed specific arguments in these generics: comparisonsTable, samplesizeTable, 
  and samplesizeGraph. The arguments included: mcadjust, contrastmatrix, device, and refgrp. 
  All of these have no meaning for the PairedDifference methods, so to use the same
  generics as used for the OneFactor methods, these are now callable through the dots
  arguments. 

* Revised Depends and Imports configurations to align with CRAN checks.

* Corrected numerous typographical errors in the help files.

24 January 2013: Version 0.9-6
==============================

* Refined use of the Hmisc::largest.empty function to avoid warning of
  "Foreign function call with ‘PACKAGE’ argument in a different package"

* Added CITATION file since a Journal of Statistical Software article on
  the manuscript is due to soon be published in 2013.

* Changed name of this file from CHANGES to NEWS and placed it in the /inst subdirectory.

13 August 2012: Version 0.9-5
=============================

* Corrected DESCRIPTION file to have only 1 maintainer, and corrected package help file to reflect the
  right version.

* No functional changes from 0-9.4

11 March 2012: Version 0.9-4
============================

* Discovered and fixed bug of stamp that notes the graph symbols used for boxplot() method

* Dependency on R 2.14.0 and VGAM 0.8.6 or greater was tested and clarified after
  finding CRAN warnings.

10 March 2012: Version 0.9-3
============================

* Cleaned up plotting of one-factor group level names on the x-axis when they are
  rotated, by making sure there is clear whitespace between the right end of each
  group name label and the x-axis.

* Cleaned up bad mixing of base graphics and grid/lattice functions in cgDevice(),
  which did not allow file output graphics devices to work properly.

27 November 2011: Version 0.9-2
===============================

* Fixed bug in print method of cgOneFactorComparisonsTable object when addpct=TRUE is
  specified for comparison of groups on untransformed data. Thanks to Journal of
  Statistics (JSS) anonymous reviewer of submitted paper of cg package for reporting
  this bug.

* For output from the comparisonsTable method, the label "geomean" is used in place
  for "mean" to make clear that geometric means are displayed. Thanks to JSS anonymous 
  reviewer for remarks that led to the decision of this label change.

* Added simple print and summary methods for the cgOneFactorFit object, again thanks
  to a suggestion of a JSS reviewer.

26 June 2011: Version 0.9-1
===========================

* Changed calls of VGAM:::cnormal1 to VGAM:::cennormal1 due to rename in 
  VGAM package when version 0.8-3 was released 17 June 2011. 

* Since VGAM 0-8.3 would not load in R 2.11 in my Windows installation, the cg package
  now requires >= R 2.12.0 and VGAM >= 0.8-3.

* Removed duplication of author and maintained email address contact in the
  DESCRIPTION FILE.

* Switched to more conventional package number versioning (from initial release
  0.9.0 (on 20 December 2010) to 0.9-1 .

* No functional changes were made in the package in this release.

* Added this CHANGES file.
